# API REST [Assembly]
Any constructive criticism is welcome. I'm learning assembly and developing this project in my spare time.

I obtained the server creation part from another repository, but I no longer have the link. Additionally,
I fragmented it for organizational purposes, and I added a few things.

## How to use
1. Download the repository
2. Download the [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) assembler, in arch linux you can use the following command: `sudo yay -S nasm`
3. Open the terminal and go to the folder where the repository is located
4. Run the following command: `make`
5. Run the following command: `./bin/server [port]`
